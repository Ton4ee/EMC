# EMC

# This is standard and basic project created from scratch . The project is used for practising for a subject called EMC(Electronic Mobile Commerce) .
# Here I have created a simple Spring + React web app , which has a products page , when entering the product page , products show up , there is a form , for adding new products , and there is a edit and delete button on the product.
# I have also implemented Login / JWT authentication ,  where you have to register and login to gain access to the page.
# Currently working on more features.
